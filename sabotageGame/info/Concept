Sabotage Game Concept //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Social deduction game where players are members of a secret agency
Within a certain number of rounds, all double agents must be found and voted out to win
If the rounds run out and double agents remain, game is won for double agents
Also, if the double agents make themselves a majority, game is won for double agents
Idea is that an important mission is about to be launched determining the outcome of a war
If double agents remain in the agency by the time of the mission, they will sabotage it
Players must gather evidence, whether by discovering it, stealing it, or transferring it to other players
This evidence is then used to determine who is a double agent or not
The only issue is that only the double agents know who each-other is,
and the double agents are capable of forging evidence against other players

Best for rather large groups of players, as small parties will make the game easier for the non-double agents
Larger groups require lots of communication and transfer of information

Players can chat at any time with a global chat or chat with a specific player
Double agents have the option to send a message to all other double agents

Gameplay ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Each round, every player makes one action. These actions are as follows:
- Search for evidence: determines whether another player is a double agent or not, the evidence gathered this way
is only known to you until another action reveals it to another player or copies it
- Pass evidence: give another player a copy of the evidence you have on another player
- Steal evidence: take copies of up to three random pieces of evidence another player has
- Forge evidence: generates evidence on another player, but only available to double agents,
and the evidence is false: saying the player is something other than what they actually are

Evidence can stack, indicating how many different sources the evidence has come from. For example, if player one
generates evidence twice on the same player, the stack will only be traced to one player still, but if two players
pass evidence on the same player to the same player, it will indicate that the evidence came from two sources in total
Player of origin will not be visible however, but could be deduced or tracked, keep your memory sharp!

At the end of every round, voting occurs to

Graphics ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Will be drawn up separately, but must contain

For action phase:
- Chat box and chat log, with a chat log that can expand and be scrolled through
- Option selector for chat log for who a message is sent to
 Must have global, double agents (if on that team), and every player as options
- Button which brings up a window with a QR code other players can scan to join the game or a code for joining the game
- Number of remaining rounds
- Ability to either select through every player, or click on each player in some sort of graphic to bring up
action options and evidence against or for them that you have
- Window for all your current evidence

For voting phase:
- Simple either pass or vote for a specific player option
- Information about evidence on each player
- Chat

Evidence stack could be represented as green and red numbers representing number of evidence for and against player

Random Events //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Since the gameplay would likely be too easy without additional events, random events may be added
These could make the game harder for the good agents in various ways
This could include evidence being convoluted, which the player generating the evidence will be informed of,
but not other players
Another way would be random events requiring a special separate mission, which requires a certain number of volunteers
Those volunteers will loose their actions that turn, but if the special mission does not have enough volunteers, or if
it contains a double agent, a round remaining might be lost.
The chance for a round being lost is equal to number of spots filled by double agents or half of the empty spots over total
Max chance then is 100% for being filled with double agents, 50% for being empty
